<h1>GenRiver version 2.0</h1>
<div>
Landuse change can substantially impact watershed function, both above and belowground, through e.g. canopy interception, evapotranspitation, and soil infiltration. Landscape assessment on the impact of landuse change to hydrology condition can help in developing appropriate watershed management. Generic River (GenRiver) flow model is a tool that links climate, landuse and soil property to the resulting river flow in a watershed, through water balance process calculated at sub-catchment level. The model considers that change in landuse and soil property as the main driving factors of change in river flow.
